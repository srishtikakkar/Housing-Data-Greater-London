# Introduction
The objective of this project was to analyze the price of a house across the Boroughs of London. The analysis involves using visualization to understand the effect of different features on the price of a house and creating an optimal model to predict the price of a house. As per the data, houses can be as old as 106+ years (pre-world war 1) and ranging from price as low as 8500 to as high as 850000 pounds. The houses are categorized as leased or freehold. It can have two to five bedrooms with one or more bathroom. Further, there are houses with or without a central heating system and different types of garage space. All these feature can have impact on the pricing of a house along with its location or which borough it is in. Different types of houses like detached, Bangalow, or flat with the different features will have different prices too.
